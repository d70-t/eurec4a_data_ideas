## functional goals

### live communication
In order to be able to quickly contact campaign participants also in groups, a live communication system should be established.

* It should be possible to contact single persons, groups of persons (e.g. based on location, instruments etc.).
* Groups should be available to everyone, it is desireable to allow everyone to see all groups and join them without invitation.
* Messages should be transported within seconds.
* Single messages will be text and / or images, generally in the order of a few KB.

### sharing measurement quicklooks
Quicklooks of measurement data should be available within a few hours to everyone interested.

* Quicklooks will be in the order of 100MB per day.
* Quicklooks may need a description, FAQ and contact information.

### quick measurement data
Quick measurement data is intended to allow other researchers to play with measured data as soon as they are available.
An example would be to compare measurement to model data.
Quickly examining measurement data may also help to improve further measurement strategies.

* Data size in the order 1-5 GB per day
* Should be available on next day
* Should be accompanied with readme, FAQ and contact information.
* Machine readable metadata might be useful

### distribution of manuals
Instrument and operating manuals are valuable in case of intrument problems.

* Should be available offline (e.g. in the aircraft)
* Might get updates during the campaign
* Should be distributed within minutes
* Order of 100MB, few changes during the campaign

### distribution of measurement and meeting protocols
Similar to manuals, these documents are potentially useful for everyone

* Should be available offline
* Will be updated multiple times a day
* Should be distributed within minutes
* Oder of 10MB to 100MB per day

### raw measurement data
All raw measurement data should be archived and processed to quality checked higher level products

* May become multiple TB per day
* Availability required only after the campaign

### Blog/Forum
A place which gathers general and current information about the field campaign

* Can be a starting point to discover available activities / data etc.
* May help to improve the feeling for everyone to be on one common campaign in stead of many individual activities
* Can inform about interesting measurements or activities

## additional goals

### simple tools
Any tool introduced will only be helpful if it is and can be used by as many users as possible. Therefore, they should be easy to leasn and use.


### few tools
More tools will be more complicated to use than few tools, so there should be as few different systems as possible.

### selectable synchronization
At some sites (i.e. ships), it may be desireable to synchronize only a subset of all data in order to save bandwidth.
It should be possible to select which data is synchronized based on platform, data type, size etc.
